        <span>Ms. Mary Leuellyn Lauron,

I hope your day ends well. I want you to know just how much I love you; no words can truly express the depth of my feelings. Imissyou and I yearn for your presence every moment, and I cherish the hope of being by your side, whether it's every day, every second, or every minute. I miss you so much; I miss our wonderful dates, our talks, and those late-night walks. Every moment I've spent with you holds a special place in my heart. 

I've made something for you, hoping it lifts your mood and brings a smile to your face. Remember,I love you always Bay! 

love, 
Kath ❤️
❤️</span>
